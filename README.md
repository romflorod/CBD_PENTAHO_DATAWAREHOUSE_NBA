# NBA Data Warehouse with Hitachi Pentaho Spoon and SQL
This is a student project aimed at creating a NBA stats database using Hitachi Pentaho Spoon Datawarehouse and SQL. The objective is to create a reliable database that 
can be used for big data and can be updated with new data.
## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Hitachi Pentaho Spoon 9.3 or higher and SQL Developer 23.1 or higher installed on your computer. Once you have the necessary software installed, you can follow the steps below to create the NBA stats database:

Open Hitachi Pentaho Spoon and create a new transformation.

Use sqldeveloper to load the script or in Spoon the "script file input" step to read in the NBA data from the provided dataset.

Use a series of "Select values" steps to transform and clean the data as needed.

Use the "Table output" step to write the cleaned data to a SQL table.

Use SQL Developer to run the provided SQL scripts to create additional tables, such as the catalog table and the top players tables.

Once all tables have been created, you can use SQL queries to extract the data you need.
